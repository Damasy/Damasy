### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

My name is Ahmed Damasy. I am a 28 year old, from Cairo, Egypt.

### Bio
I am a JavaScript Software Engineer with more than 5 years of full-time work experience. I currently work mainly with JavaScript, as well as with Typescript, Angular, React, and Vue. I started my career as a Front-end developer.

I have been worked with client projects in the USA, Germany, Turkey, UAE, and KSA.

Iâ€™m a teacher and a bit of a geek, who loves finding new problems to solve or better solutions to a known problem. In my free time, I enjoy teaching coding, reading about new technologies, and open-source projects.
